      <p>
        Publications Division is a repository of books and journals highlighting subjects of national importance and India’s rich cultural heritage. Established in 1941, Publications Division has emerged as a premier publishing house of the Government of India, enriching the national knowledge repository in distinctive streams as under :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>(i) Preserving and showcasing India’s heritage with quality publications on land and people, history of the freedom movement, art and culture, flora and fauna, Gandhian literature, biographies of the builders of modern India during the freedom movement, leading luminaries in the field of culture, philosophy, science, literature, etc.</li>
        <li>(ii) Bringing out speeches of the Presidents/ Prime Ministers, books on contemporary science, economy, history, and other subjects with an underlying focus on Indian society and readership.</li>
        <li>(iii) Bringing out children’s literature—fiction and non-fiction material with the broad objective of providing infotainment, spreading awareness about the land, people, heritage, culture, and society, aiming at inculcating human values and scientific temper among children.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The contribution of DPD assumes importance as being a unique publishing house competing in the market on one hand, and a pioneer government organization on the other. The Division played a pioneering role in publishing classic works during the days when the Indian publishing industry was nascent and media reach was limited.

    <h4 class="section-title mb-3">Gandhian Literature & Contributions</h4>
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>
        Books on the life and thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi hold a place of pride for the Division. Publications Division has published several books on Gandhian thoughts including the <strong>Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (CWMG)</strong> in 100 volumes, in English, and <strong>Sampoorna Gandhi Vangmaya</strong> in Hindi which is considered to be the most comprehensive and authentic collection of Gandhiji’s writings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Division enjoys credibility among the publishers and is well recognised for the authenticity of the content and affordable price of publications. Publications Division, in collaboration with Gujarat Vidyapeeth, and under the supervision of prominent Gandhian scholars, has also prepared the e-version of the Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (<strong>e-CWMG</strong>), a fully searchable master copy in the form of a well-designed set of DVDs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This monumental work is a lasting contribution to the national heritage by preserving Mahatma Gandhi’s written words in permanent and tamper-proof electronic format. The e-CWMG is also hosted on the Gandhi Heritage Portal, a comprehensive repository of authentic Gandhian literature. The endeavor to get more Gandhian titles is continuing.
